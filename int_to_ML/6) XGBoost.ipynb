This method dominates many Kaggle competitions and achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.\n","\n","# Introduction\n","\n","For much of this course, you have made predictions with the random forest method, which achieves better performance than a single decision tree simply by averaging the predictions of many decision trees.\n","\n","We refer to the random forest method as an \"ensemble method\".  By definition, **ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).  \n","\n","Next, we'll learn about another ensemble method called gradient boosting.  \n","\n","# Gradient Boosting\n","\n","**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.  \n","\n","It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive.  (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n","\n","Then, we start the cycle:\n","- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset.  To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.  \n","- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), for instance).\n","- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble.  Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss.  (*Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.*)\n","- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n","- ... repeat!\n","\n","![tut6_boosting](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/MvCGENh.png)\n","\n","\n","# Example\n","\n","We begin by loading the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"id":"dZ9qOmb70aCi"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","# Read the data\n","data = pd.read_csv('../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv')\n","\n","# Select subset of predictors\n","cols_to_use = ['Rooms', 'Distance', 'Landsize', 'BuildingArea', 'YearBuilt']\n","X = data[cols_to_use]\n","\n","# Select target\n","y = data.Price\n","\n","# Separate data into training and validation sets\n","X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mhZ74Fk80aCj"},"source":["In this example, you'll work with the XGBoost library.  **XGBoost** stands for **extreme gradient boosting**, which is an implementation of gradient boosting with several additional features focused on performance and speed.
